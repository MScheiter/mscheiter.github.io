Welcome to my homepage! I'm Matthias, a Mathematical Geophysicist and currently working as a postdoc at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. 

On these pages you can find some information about my research and wider interests. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, feedback or ideas for collaboration!


This website is still in the build-up phase, but some things are already working. For example, you can check out a short but fine list of <a href="https://mscheiter.github.io/publications/" target="_blank">absolutely riveting literature</a>!
