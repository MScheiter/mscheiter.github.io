I am a Mathematical Geophysicist with interests in ice sheet modelling, deep learning, and Bayesian inference, currently employed as a Research Associate at the <a href="https://antarctic.org.au/" target="_blank">Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science</a>. Prior to my role at University of Tasmania, I completed my PhD at The Australian National University. The project at ANU was focused on finding and exploiting theoretical connections between established Monte Carlo methods and the emerging field of generative deep learning. In my Master thesis, I worked in ice sheet modelling of a Chilean glacier and projected its future under different climate scenarios until the end of the current century. During this time, I also acquired fieldwork experience on glaciers and lakes in Patagonia. My new role at UTas covers many of my prior interests and so it is a unique opportunity to work at the interface of statistical methods and glaciology.
